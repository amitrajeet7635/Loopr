## 🎯 Objective

### What problem does our project solve?
Loopr simplifies recurring crypto payments by bringing **subscription management** to Solana. Today, dApps and Web3 merchants struggle with handling recurring payments, cross-chain fragmentation, and smooth onboarding for non-crypto-native users. Loopr solves this by providing a **Web SDK and mobile application** that enable seamless subscription setup, checkout with Solana Pay, and reward-based engagement — all without custodial risk.

### Who does it serve?
Loopr serves both **merchants** and **end-users**. For merchants, it offers a plug-and-play SDK to integrate subscriptions directly into their platforms, eliminating the need to build complex billing infrastructure. For users, it provides a smooth checkout experience, clear subscription management, and reward incentives for loyalty. Developers gain a universal tool for recurring payments, while end-users get **transparency, control, and convenience**.

### Real-World Use Case:
Meet Riya, a freelance designer in Bangalore who subscribes to multiple Web3 design tools and AI platforms. Traditionally, she would need to manually send tokens each month or rely on clunky, centralized fiat services. With Loopr, Riya simply selects the “Pro Plan” from a dApp’s pricing page. On checkout, she clicks **“Pay with Loopr”**, which instantly generates a Solana Pay QR code. She scans and pays once — her subscription is now automated on-chain.

On the merchant side, the AI platform’s developer integrates Loopr SDK in just a few lines of code, gaining access to:

* **Plan configuration** (monthly, quarterly, yearly pricing in USD → auto-converted to SOL),
* **Subscription management** (renewals, cancellations),
* **Reward points** to incentivize long-term users.

No manual invoicing, no fragmented tools — just **seamless, transparent subscription management on Solana**.

---

## 🧠 Our Approach
 
### **Why we chose this problem:**
Managing subscriptions today is fragmented and frustrating. Subscriptions are scattered across cards, banks, and platforms. Cancelling or modifying requires contacting individual merchants. Users lack transparency, there are hidden charges or forgotten renewals pile up. Traditional payment systems (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal) are centralized and slow to innovate.

We chose this problem because subscriptions are the backbone of modern digital life — streaming, gaming, SaaS, fitness, education — yet the tools to manage them are outdated.

Loopr brings on-chain transparency, one-click control, and automated organization so users never feel locked in, overcharged, or lost in spreadsheets again.

### **How we solved this:**
1. **Loopr SDK for Recurring Payments** — We built a plug-and-play SDK that any company can integrate into their apps or websites. It enables recurring subscription payments powered by Solana Pay — without the complexity of managing autopay across banks and wallets.
2. **One App for All Subscriptions** — Instead of scattered autopays, multiple cards, and messy tracking, Loopr provides a single dashboard where users can see, manage, pause, or cancel all subscriptions in one place. It’s not just another analytics app — it’s a control center for your digital life.
3. **Solana QR Support** — Loopr works seamlessly with Solana Pay QRs. For dynamic Loopr QRs, subscription details are auto-filled. For static Solana QRs, users simply enter details manually, making it universally compatible.
4. **Smooth Onboarding with Web3Auth** — We integrated Web3Auth social logins so users can sign in with familiar Web2 methods (Google, Twitter, etc.) while still being onboarded into a Web3 wallet. This lowers friction and makes adoption easy.
5. **Rewards Layer with NFTs** — Every payment interaction (scanning a QR, subscribing, renewing) saves user metadata and subscription analytics on-chain. This allows companies to send curated NFT rewards that strengthen community engagement. The more loyal the user, the more exclusive the rewards.

   
### ✨ Key Features

Major Highlights of your project:

- ✅ Plug-and-play SDK for recurring subscription payments
- ✅ All-in-one mobile app to track, manage, pause, or cancel subscriptions
- ✅ Web3Auth social logins for seamless Web2 → Web3 onboarding
- ✅ Solana Pay QR support — dynamic auto-fill or manual setup for static QRs
- ✅ NFT rewards layer to engage and reward loyal subscribers
- ✅ On-chain transparency with verifiable transactions and spend insights


### 🧠 Why This Makes Sense for Loopr — And Where It’s Going

> ⚡️ **The Real Struggle**
>
> Right now, subscriptions are messy. Users juggle multiple cards, wallets, and banks just to keep track of recurring payments. Cancelling often means contacting a merchant, hidden charges slip through, and there’s no unified way to manage everything. For companies, integrating recurring payments means relying on centralized processors that limit flexibility and user control. This complexity stops both users and businesses from truly embracing decentralized payments for everyday subscriptions.
>
> But with **Loopr**, it’s different. Subscriptions become simple, transparent, and on-chain. Users onboard instantly with Web3Auth social logins — no seed phrases, no complex wallet setup. At checkout on any app/web, “Pay with Loopr” generates a QR. The user scans with the Loopr app → payment is made, subscription auto-tracked in their dashboard.
>
> Cancelling or pausing is one click on-chain — no merchant approval needed. Every payment is verifiable, transparent, and organized.
>
> For businesses, our plug-and-play Web SDK means integrating recurring Web3 payments is as simple as dropping in a button.ou onboard instantly — just sign in with your social login. No seed phrases. No extensions. No confusion. It feels like a regular app — but under the hood, it’s Web3-powered.
>
> But this is only the beginning. Our roadmap includes expanding and becomes a universal option across merchants, building smarter dashboards with spending insights and alerts, and scaling our rewards system where every payment interaction can unlock curated NFT rewards. These NFTs aren’t just collectibles — they’re tools for brands to connect more deeply with loyal users, turning subscriptions into an engaging, reward-driven ecosystem.
>
> In the long run, Loopr isn’t just another subscription tracker. It’s a complete rethinking of how subscriptions should work in the Web3 era: transparent, user-first, and reward-powered. Subscriptions are everywhere in modern life, and Loopr is here to make them effortless for users and smarter for businesses.


### Flow of our entire Loopr Ecosystem:
1. User signs in via Web3Auth social login (Google, Twitter, etc.) A non-custodial wallet is created under the hood — no seed phrases, no complexity.
2. Businesses/ Merchants use the Loopr SDK, eliminating the need to build complex billing infrastructure. 
3. On a merchant’s website, user clicks “Pay with Loopr.
4. A dynamic QR code is generated. User opens the Loopr app and scans the QR.
5. For Loopr dynamic QRs → subscription details are auto-filled & for static Solana Pay QRs → user manually enters amount and billing cycle.
6. Payment is processed via Solana Pay and you are good to go ! 
7. User receives confirmation + optional NFT reward (coupon, collectible, or perk). Subscription details are saved on-chain and synced to the Loopr dashboard. Get alerts & insights for better budgeting
8. Every interaction (payment, renewal, milestone) can trigger NFT rewards curated by companies. NFTs help businesses engage loyal users while giving users portable, tradeable value.

### **Ahhh! Some pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking:**
1. **Switched from Static Wallets to Web3Auth Social Logins** — We realized it would create massive friction for new users. Hence we moved to _Web3Auth_, this gave us a smooth Web2-like experience while staying Web3-native.
2. **Dynamic vs Static QR Handling** - At first, we planned to only support our own Loopr-generated QRs. Then we realized that merchants (and users) already use Solana Pay QRs. We engineered support for both.
3. **Rewards Layer via NFTs** - We debated whether rewards should just be points or badges. But points = Web2, closed, and boring. Hence we decided to issue NFT rewards tied to subscription activity. These NFTs can be collectibles, coupons, or perks — and most importantly, they’re portable and tradeable. This turned subscriptions into an _engagement channel for companies_, not just payments.
4. **Contract Stack Exploration** - We initially considered building contracts directly in Rust with Solana. But to speed things up and simplify dev experience, we narrowed down to _Solana Pay’s proven base layer_, then layered Loopr’s subscription + reward logic on top. This gave us a balance of both stability and innovation.
