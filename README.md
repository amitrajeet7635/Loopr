## üéØ Objective

### What problem does our project solve?
Loopr simplifies recurring crypto payments by bringing **subscription management** to Solana. Today, dApps and Web3 merchants struggle with handling recurring payments, cross-chain fragmentation, and smooth onboarding for non-crypto-native users. Loopr solves this by providing a **Web SDK and mobile application** that enable seamless subscription setup, checkout with Solana Pay, and reward-based engagement ‚Äî all without custodial risk.

### Who does it serve?
Loopr serves both **merchants** and **end-users**. For merchants, it offers a plug-and-play SDK to integrate subscriptions directly into their platforms, eliminating the need to build complex billing infrastructure. For users, it provides a smooth checkout experience, clear subscription management, and reward incentives for loyalty. Developers gain a universal tool for recurring payments, while end-users get **transparency, control, and convenience**.

### Real-World Use Case:
Meet Riya, a freelance designer in Bangalore who subscribes to multiple Web3 design tools and AI platforms. Traditionally, she would need to manually send tokens each month or rely on clunky, centralized fiat services. With Loopr, Riya simply selects the ‚ÄúPro Plan‚Äù from a dApp‚Äôs pricing page. On checkout, she clicks **‚ÄúPay with Loopr‚Äù**, which instantly generates a Solana Pay QR code. She scans and pays once ‚Äî her subscription is now automated on-chain.

On the merchant side, the AI platform‚Äôs developer integrates Loopr SDK in just a few lines of code, gaining access to:

* **Plan configuration** (monthly, quarterly, yearly pricing in USD ‚Üí auto-converted to SOL),
* **Subscription management** (renewals, cancellations),
* **Reward points** to incentivize long-term users.

No manual invoicing, no fragmented tools ‚Äî just **seamless, transparent subscription management on Solana**.

---

## üß† Our Approach
 
### **Why we chose this problem:**
Managing subscriptions today is fragmented and frustrating. Subscriptions are scattered across cards, banks, and platforms. Cancelling or modifying requires contacting individual merchants. Users lack transparency, there are hidden charges or forgotten renewals pile up. Traditional payment systems (Visa, Mastercard, PayPal) are centralized and slow to innovate.

We chose this problem because subscriptions are the backbone of modern digital life ‚Äî streaming, gaming, SaaS, fitness, education ‚Äî yet the tools to manage them are outdated.

Loopr brings on-chain transparency, one-click control, and automated organization so users never feel locked in, overcharged, or lost in spreadsheets again.
We believe financial literacy and independence should start early, and ZAAP offers a way to do that without compromising security, privacy, or trust.

### **How we solved this:**
1. **Loopr SDK for Recurring Payments** ‚Äî We built a plug-and-play SDK that any company can integrate into their apps or websites. It enables recurring subscription payments powered by Solana Pay ‚Äî without the complexity of managing autopay across banks and wallets.
2. **One App for All Subscriptions** ‚Äî Instead of scattered autopays, multiple cards, and messy tracking, Loopr provides a single dashboard where users can see, manage, pause, or cancel all subscriptions in one place. It‚Äôs not just another analytics app ‚Äî it‚Äôs a control center for your digital life.
3. **Solana QR Support** ‚Äî Loopr works seamlessly with Solana Pay QRs. For dynamic Loopr QRs, subscription details are auto-filled. For static Solana QRs, users simply enter details manually, making it universally compatible.
4. **Smooth Onboarding with Web3Auth** ‚Äî We integrated Web3Auth social logins so users can sign in with familiar Web2 methods (Google, Twitter, etc.) while still being onboarded into a Web3 wallet. This lowers friction and makes adoption easy.
5. **Rewards Layer with NFTs** ‚Äî Every payment interaction (scanning a QR, subscribing, renewing) saves user metadata and subscription analytics on-chain. This allows companies to send curated NFT rewards that strengthen community engagement. The more loyal the user, the more exclusive the rewards.

### üß† Why This Makes Sense for MetaMask Card Users ‚Äî And Where It‚Äôs Going

> ‚ö°Ô∏è **The Problem**
>
> Right now, Web3 is still way too complicated ‚Äî especially for the next-gen. You‚Äôve got to create a wallet, manage private/public keys, handle gas, and figure out how to move funds. It‚Äôs a mess. That complexity stops normal users from adopting Web3 for daily payments.
>
> But with **ZAAP**, it‚Äôs different. You onboard instantly ‚Äî just sign in with your social login. No seed phrases. No extensions. No confusion. It feels like a regular app ‚Äî but under the hood, it‚Äôs Web3-powered.
>
> Imagine a teen with a **MetaMask Card** linked to their delegated wallet. They can just swipe or scan to pay at any store, kiosk, or merchant. The transaction happens in USDC, and their parent gets an instant update. They can fund the wallet, set limits, or pause access ‚Äî all from their web dashboard.
>
> The MetaMask Card isn‚Äôt live yet, so we couldn‚Äôt test swipes directly ‚Äî but everything else is ready. Once it's launched, ZAAP fits in directly. We‚Äôre also looking ahead: in India, we plan to integrate **UPI payments**, making it even more real-world ready.
>
> And forget about gas fees ‚Äî we sponsor them. Users can pay a small annual fee and never worry about onchain transaction costs. That‚Äôs a big UX win.
>
> Looking forward, we can build loyalty and reward layers on top. We already track spending, saving, and limits ‚Äî so we can partner with **teen-focused brands** to offer cashbacks, streak rewards, or custom deals. It makes ZAAP sticky, fun, and personal.
>
> This isn‚Äôt just another payment app. It‚Äôs **real-world Web3 adoption** ‚Äî where MetaMask Cards help teens gain financial freedom, while parents keep control. Zero banks, zero friction, 100% ZAAP.


### Flow of our APP:
1. Parent first connect existing Metamask Wallet(Or create a new wallet )
2. Add a new child profile - set nickname, amount to be spend and Done.. 
3. Click on Show QR
4. On the mobile app, first login with your socials, and then you'd be prompted to setup Zaap CircleLink
5. Scan the QR from there, shown on the web dashboard and here you go ... ! 
6. Now you can start Zaaping
7. Scan & Pay, Transfer to wallet addresses, Deposit in wallet, Check your set limits thru your phone, Setup monthly goals and much more unlocked !!

### **Ahhh! Some pivots, brainstorms, or breakthroughs during hacking:**
1. Switched from Traditional Wallets to Smart Accounts ‚Äî We shifted to MetaMask DTK for flexible, delegated wallet access without compromising control, this also gave us added advantages.
2. Reduction of Gas Fees - As we have used Metamask DTK, we got the advantage, to sponsor gas fees enabling smooth user experience.
3. Brainstormed Dual Experience (Parent + Teen) ‚Äî Decided to split experiences across mobile (for teens) and web (for parents) to optimize UX per user role.
4. Breakthrough Using Circle & MetaMask Card for Spending ‚Äî Realized we could route transactions via MetaMask/Circle cards to simulate real-world teen payments.
5. Child and Parent Wallet Connect - We engineered this thing on our own, and it has been a major breakthru. Connecting wallets was never more simpler than this.
6. At first we thought to go with Linea, but then due to some problems/issues from their dev end, we shifted to ethereum.

100% ‚Äî this is not just a one-weekend hack.
We‚Äôve already built a working Web SDK (npm package) and a functional Android app prototype, and have been heads down on this for weeks.
Loopr is here to stay. While this submission marks a milestone, our team is actively working to fix bugs and enhance the product. Also we have more ideas to expand and scale this further.
If we receive enough positive feedback and community interest, we‚Äôll take this from prototype to full production release.
